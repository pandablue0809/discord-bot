<h1>Rules for Contribution</h1>

<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>Always open pull requests with your edits and clearly describe what you're changing and why it would contribute to this project. They will be reviewed by the contributors with writing access and maybe merged with main.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>In the issues tab you may report bugs and suggest features and changes. Please take a look at all the issues and only open a new one when you're positive that nobody else has similar posts.</p>

<h2>Code Style</h2>

<p>Use a consistent naming technique (snake_case) and make your code consistently indented to improve readability and not burn the reviewer's eyes. Rust not being indent-dependent does not mean that you should write unreadable code.</p>
